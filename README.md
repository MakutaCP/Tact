A small tactics game for a code Louisville project.

Move your units in turn based tactics prototype.
At least one way to win. If you find more please let me know.

c# core

-Master loop for quick retrys
-List recieves possible next moves automatically and returns the so your units move the right way
-Visualize unit data on a board for map view
-Two different unit classes that each have seperate movement options

I ran from command line with dotnet run. Game gives instructions after that.
